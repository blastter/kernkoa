KernKoa

Kern = Kernel (German)
Koa = Kernel (Japanese)

Definition
KernKoa is an easy to use kernel (or BackBone if you prefer) for webservices to develop fast webservices based in python, with dinamic routes calling libraries clases and method using the URL. The URL based calls make easy and to implement webpages in python so you dont hav to configure complex route files and you can faste test you web application.
KernKoa, now is implemented using Flask (microframework) as base to make the dynamic routing to generate instances of classes from a specific lybrary and the call methods with parameters. And it's runing on NGinX passing throw UWSGI.<br>
Example:<br>
http://example.exmaple.com/folder/library/class/method?parameter1=value1&....&paramaterN=valueN

The KernKoa Proyect is designed to implement very modular solutions, and you can port from one kernkoa page or webservice to another easily if you have the correct configuration of databases and other things in the destination kernkoa server.
This backbone or kerner if you prefer is designed to use MVC to keep separate Models, Views (Templates using Werkzeug), Controllers. In the configuration file (config.py) you can configure the paths to different folder to contain the different modules for controllers, models and templates.

Looking into the folder structure, you can define it as you want (in config.py) but the preconfigured is:<br>
|-KernKoaFolder<br>
	|-catalog<br>
	|	|-controller<br>
	|	|-model<br>
	|	|-print<br>
	|-templates<br>
	|-images<br>
	|-pdfs<br>
	|-system<br>
	|	|-addons<br>
	|	|-core<br>

Instalation of KernKoa:


Configuration of KernKoa:
There are two steps to configure KernKoa, the configuration of the project and the configuration of the server:
- Project configuration: is the configuration of each configuration files in the proyect. you can find 3 configuration files config.py, kernkoa_uwsgi.ini and kernkoa_nginx.conf.
	+ config.py: is the base configuration of KernKoa, here you can configure base path for the system, base URL, databases, folders names, name of the project (if you change it to other name), and so on. For more information read config.py file.
	+ kernkoa_uwsgi.ini: configuration of uwsgi fast cgi script, read it to change paramenters.
	+ kernkoa_nginx.conf: server and routing options for NGinX, read it to configure it.
